How many Emoji can you recall from memory?

This is very much a work in progress, so plz don't share it. If you wanna get
updates on progress, subscribe to the repo :+1: :+1:

## Thanks to

[Eddie Li] for the idea.

[Tim Whitlock's Emoji Unicode Tables] for giving me Unicode code points of various
Emoji so that I didn't have to type them all in manually.

[OpenSansEmoji] allows this to work more consistently well on non-Android linux
clients.
